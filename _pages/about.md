Hi, I'm Madi! I am currently a senior at Michigan State University, working towards a BS in Computer Science alongside studies in Game Design & Development, with a focus in art. Throughout my time at MSU, I've engaged in several collaborative indie video game projects, which have significantly improved my technical and artistic skills.

Outside of class, you will likely find me playing video games, doing colorguard, or baking.
